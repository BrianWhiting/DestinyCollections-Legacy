# Destiny Sets

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

* A fairly recent installation of Node - I use v8.9.3
* Able to use Terminal/bash

1. Copy `.env.local-sample` to `.env.local` and fill in `REACT_APP_API_KEY` and
   `REACT_APP_AUTH_URL` with your Bungie.net API key and and auth URL (see below
   for how to get these)

2. Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you have Yarn)

3. Run the local dev server with `npm start` (or `yarn install` if you have
   Yarn)

4. You should see "Compiled successfully!", with instructions, and the site
   should open in your browser.

   * Note, as we're using HTTPS locally with a self-signed certificate, you'll
     get a security warning. You'll need to 'proceed anyway' to continue.
