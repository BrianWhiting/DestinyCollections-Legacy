# Destiny Sets

List weapon and armour drops for each of the new strikes in the video game Destiny.

## Getting started

For development, you'll need to [create at least one set of Bungie API credentials](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application). Once you have them, create a `appConfig.js` file in the root of the project to enter the details into - see `appConfig.sample.js`.

This project uses Yarn, you'll also need to install that. Once done, you can install this applications dependencies with `yarn install`;

Then, run the application locally with `npm start`. Your web browser should automatically open and after a few moments it should load.
